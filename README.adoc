The TrackIt API is now listening on 127.0.0.1:8580

= Web UI

A web UI is available on the https://github.com/trackit/trackit2-client[trackit-client repository]

The API exposes its own documentation on the `GET /docs` route, in JSON format.
Also, the documentation for each route can be retrieved by an `OPTIONS`
request. We are working on an actual viewer for this.
